 * Name: Taran Preet Singh
 * I, Taran Preet Singh, confirms that this work of Assignment 5 belongs to me, It's my original work
 * and has not been copied by anyone.
 *
 * It includes managing aisles inside a shopping store where we have fast and normal lanes
 * whose data is retrieved from a text file named CustomerData.txt, where all info regarding lanes and customers are given.
 * Using which the following code has been designed by me. It contains Two parts- A & B.
 * Part A contains managing the customers into the aisles and Part B gives the count of customers inside the store after
 * an interval of 30 secs, until the there are no customers.
